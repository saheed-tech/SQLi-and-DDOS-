Quick, beginner-friendly notes on two common web threats:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: how it happens, how to spot it, and how to prevent it  
- **DDoS**: what it is, key indicators, and practical mitigation strategies

> ✅ Defensive/educational only — no attack instructions.

## What’s inside
- 📄 Short summaries + checklists  
- 🔎 Detection indicators (logs/metrics to watch)  
- ✅ Mitigation best practices (secure coding + WAF/CDN + rate limiting)

## Sections
- **SQLi:** `./sqli/`
- **DDoS:** `./ddos/`

## Key takeaways
- SQLi is prevented mainly with **parameterized queries** + **least privilege**
- DDoS is reduced with **CDN/DDoS protection** + **rate limits** + **monitoring**
